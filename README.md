Aeroelastic Reduced Order Model creation library for CFD aerodynamics

This software is distributed under the license available in LICENSE.MD. If you did not receive the license file with the source code, 
please refer to the website https://github.com/Nicola-Fonzi/pysu2dmd.

This framework is intended to create reduced order models for aeroelastic applications starting from high fidelity, CFD data. The python routines 
naturally works with the open-source code SU2. However, provided that the input files are given with the correct format, any CFD software can do the job.

The capabilities of the package have been presented in INSERT THE REFERENCE. In order to reproduce the tutorials, it is required to have the related data.
Due to the large dimension of the files, it was not possible to upload the data on github, but this is available by directly contacting the author at
nicola.fonzi@polimi.it
